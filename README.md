# Solidity-Notes
These notes are not prepared by me these are from [tutorial](https://cryptozombies.io/)
## contracts
Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications — all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects.
An empty contract named `HelloWorld` would look like this:
```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

}
```

## Version Pragma
All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use. This is to prevent issues with future compiler versions potentially introducing changes that would break your code.

For the scope of this tutorial, we'll want to be able to compile our smart contracts with any compiler version in the range of 0.5.0 (inclusive) to 0.6.0 (exclusive). It looks like this: `pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;`.

Putting it together, here is a bare-bones starting contract — the first thing you'll write every time you start a new project:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {

}

```
## State Variables & Integers
### State variables
State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. This means they're written to the Ethereum blockchain. Think of them like writing to a DB.
```solidity
contract Example {
  // This will be stored permanently in the blockchain
  uint myUnsignedInteger = 100;
}

```
In this example contract, we created a `uint` called `myUnsignedInteger` and set it equal to 100.
### Unsigned Integers: uint
The `uint` data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. There's also an `int` data type for signed integers.

>Note: In Solidity, `uint` is actually an alias for `uint256`, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits — `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

## Math Operations
Math in Solidity is pretty straightforward. The following operations are the same as in most programming languages:

Addition: x + y
Subtraction: x - y,
Multiplication: x * y
Division: x / y
Modulus / remainder: x % y (for example, 13 % 5 is 3, because if you divide 5 into 13, 3 is the remainder)

Solidity also supports an exponential operator (i.e. "x to the power of y", x^y):
```solidity
uint x = 5 ** 2; // equal to 5^2 = 25
```

## Structs
```solidity
struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}
```
Structs allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties.

>Note that we just introduced a new type, string. Strings are used for arbitrary-length UTF-8 data. Ex. string greeting = "Hello world!"

## Arrays
When you want a collection of something, you can use an array. There are two types of arrays in Solidity: fixed arrays and dynamic arrays:
```solidity
// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:
uint[2] fixedArray;
// another fixed Array, can contain 5 strings:
string[5] stringArray;
// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:
uint[] dynamicArray;
```
You can also create an array of structs. Using the previous chapter's Person struct:
```solidity
Person[] people; // dynamic Array, we can keep adding to it
```
Remember that state variables are stored permanently in the blockchain? So creating a dynamic array of structs like this can be useful for storing structured data in your contract, kind of like a database.

### Public Arrays
You can declare an array as public, and Solidity will automatically create a `getter` method for it. The syntax looks like:
```solidity
Person[] public people;
```
Other contracts would then be able to read from, but not write to, this array. So this is a useful pattern for storing public data in your contract.
